DGen was originally written by Dave <dave@dtmnt.com>. It was ported to SDL by
Joe Groff <joe@pknet.com> and Phil K. Hornung <falcon@pknet.com>.

The following people have also made contributions to DGen:

Andrew Bazan <abazan@mailbag.com>
  - Got DGen/SDL to run under BeOS.
Steve Snake <snake@toodarkpark.freeserve.co.uk>
  - The author of the best DOS emulator KGen, was also very patient with my
    stupid questions about the Genesis, thus allowing me to fix little
    emulation quirks. ;)
Amy Lear <Amikins@operamail.net>
  - Helped add 8-bit sound support. :)
Daniel Wislocki <wislocki@math.grin.edu>
  - Improved the sound engine to be nicer to higher-end systems.
John Stiles <stiles@emulation.net>
  - He works on the Mac port of DGen, and what a job he does! He wrote the
    original raster engine, and also has sped things up enormously.
Dylan Griffiths <Dylan_G@bigfoot.com>
  - Rewrote a lot of the string-handling code to make it much less evil-looking.
Allen Noe <psyclone42@geocities.com>
  - Added screenshot functionality.
Jeff Grady <jgrady@chimera.acm.jhu.edu>
  - Fixed compilation problems with gcc snapshots.
