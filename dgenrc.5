.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dgenrc
.Nd file containing settings for
.Xr dgen 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
$HOME/.dgen/dgenrc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa $HOME/.dgen/dgenrc
is parsed by
.Xr dgen 1
when the emuator is started. It is used to set controller keys, as well as other
characteristics of the emulation. The contents of this file may be overriden
with the contents of another similarly-formatted file, via the
.Fl r
commandline switch.
.Sh FILE FORMAT
Each rc file consists of an unlimited number of lines, which each have the
format 'fieldname = value'. A line may also be a comment, if it begins with the
hash mark (#) character.
.Pp
Each
.Ar fieldname
is prepended by a name, which identifies the type of this field:
.Bl -tag -width bool_*
.It Ar key_*
A key value. May be set to a key identifier listed in the
.Sx KEY INDENTIFIERS
section below.
.It Ar bool_*
A boolean value. "false", "no", and "0" values are taken as false, while
"true", "yes", and any number except 0 are taken as true.
.It Ar int_*
An integer value, greater than or equal to 0.
.It Ar str_*
A string value, can be empty.
.El
.Pp
Some fields take special value sets, which are addressed in their respective
sections. None of the field names or values are case-sensitive.
.Pp
The fields fall under a few basic groups. They are listed below, with their
default values in brackets ([]):
.Pp
All of them can be modified interactively from the prompt, as described in
.Xr dgen 1 .
.Sh CONTROLLERS
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_pad1_up [up]
.It key_pad1_down [down]
.It key_pad1_left [left]
.It key_pad1_right [right]
.It key_pad1_a [a]
.It key_pad1_b [s]
.It key_pad1_c [d]
.It key_pad1_x [q]
.It key_pad1_y [w]
.It key_pad1_z [e]
.It key_pad1_mode [backspace]
.It key_pad1_start [return]
Map keys to the first Genesis controller. Each of these fields has a
corresponding "key_pad2" field, to map to the second controller.
.It bool_joystick [true]
Use joysticks to emulate the controllers. Note that the keyboard keys will
still work if this value is set. This field is only available if you have
joystick support enabled.
.It int_joystick1_dev [0]
.It int_joystick2_dev [1]
Select which joystick device to use. Parameter is an integer passed to
.Fn SDL_JoystickOpen .
.It int_joystick1_axisX [0]
.It int_joystick1_axisY [1]
.It int_joystick2_axisX [0]
.It int_joystick2_axisY [1]
Maps joystick axes. Default is 0 for X and 1 for Y. Useful for joysticks with
more than two or switched axes.
.It bool_joystick1_axisX [false]
.It bool_joystick1_axisY [false]
.It bool_joystick2_axisX [false]
.It bool_joystick2_axisY [false]
Enable this to reverse axes.
.It joypadX_bY [value]
Maps button number Y, on joystick X to a Genesis controller button. Valid
button values are "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", "z", "mode", and "start". Joystick
1 will always emulate controller 1, and joystick 2 will always emulate
controller 2.
.It joypadX_bY [key_*]
Maps button number Y, on joystick X to any key_* action.
.It joypadX_bY ["string"]
Maps button number Y, on joystick X to any command described in this manual as
if typed from the interactive prompt.
.El
.Sh AUDIO
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It bool_sound [true]
Enable the sound subsystem.
.It int_soundrate [22050]
Sound frequency to play at, in hertz (Hz).
.It int_soundsegs [8]
Number of sound segments to use for sound buffering. Lower values guarantee
low latency. Increment this only if the sound becomes choppy.
.It int_soundsamples [0]
Size of the system sound buffer, in samples (samples are the sound unit, sound
rate is how many of them are played every second). Specifying 0 automatically
choses the safest value. If you experience sound issues int_soundsegs is
unable to solve, try to change this. Increasing it will cause noticeable audio
lag (it is unfortunately often required on slower machines).
.It int_volume [100]
Volume level, in percent. Values above 100 cause distorsion.
.It key_volume_inc [=]
.It key_volume_dec [-]
Key bindings for volume control.
.El
.Sh VIDEO
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It int_depth [0]
Color depth (bits per pixel). Allowed values are 0 (automatic), 8, 15, 16, 24
and 32. Ignored in OpenGL mode.
.It int_width [-1]
.It int_height [-1]
Desired window width and height.
.It bool_opengl [true]
Use the OpenGL renderer, if it is available.
.It bool_opengl_aspect [true]
Retain original aspect ratio when resizing OpenGL window.
.It bool_opengl_linear [true]
Use GL_LINEAR for textures filtering instead of GL_NEAREST.
.It bool_opengl_32bit [true]
Use 32 bit textures. They require more memory but are usually faster than 16
bit textures.
.It bool_opengl_square [false]
Use square textures. Wastes a lot of memory but may solve OpenGL
initialization failures.
.It bool_fullscreen [false]
Try to run fullscreen, if possible.
.It int_scale [-1]
.It int_scale_x [-1]
.It int_scale_y [-1]
Amount by which to scale the rendered screen from the default resolution. See
scaling filters.
.It key_fullscreen_toggle [alt-enter]
Key to toggle fullscreen mode (this may do nothing if SDL doesn't support
fullscreen toggling on your platform.)
.It int_info_height [-1]
Height of the text area at the bottom of the screen, in pixels. This also
affects the font size. Values smaller than the minimum font size make DGen
redirect text to stdout instead. The default value of -1 makes DGen choose the
proper height.
.It bool_fps [false]
Display the current number of frames per second.
.It bool_swab [false]
Swap bytes in the video output. Sometimes useful when video output is located
on a different system. This is implemented as a CTV filter which must be
compiled-in to work.
.El
.Sh SAVE STATES
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_slot_X [X]
Sets the current save-state slot to number X.
.It key_save [f2]
Saves state to the current slot.
.It key_load [f3]
Loads state from the current slot.
.El
.Sh MISCELLANEOUS KEYS
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_fix_checksum [f1]
Fixes the checksum value. Some older games will freeze with a red screen if
the ROM has been hacked or modified with Game Genie codes. If it does, pressing
this, and resetting should fix the problem.
.It key_quit [escape]
Exit DGen or switch to the next ROM on the command-line.
.It key_craptv_toggle [f5]
Toggles Crap-TV image filters. These filters aren't available in 8 bpp mode.
.It key_scaling_toggle [f6]
Toggles scaling algorithms. See scaling_startup below.
.It key_reset [tab]
Restart the Genesis emulation.
.It key_cpu_toggle [f11]
Switch CPU emulators. The x86 assembly CPU emulator StarScream is fast, but
has glitches which affect a few games. Switching to the slower Musashi core
will fix these problems, at a speed penalty.
.It key_z80_toggle [f10]
Switch Z80 emulators. MZ80 is a bit faster than CZ80, particularly in its
assembly version (only available for x86), but CZ80 works with more
games. This key can also disable Z80 emulation.
.It key_stop [z]
Pause emulation, so you can concentrate on real life for a few seconds. :)
.It key_game_genie [f9]
Enter a Game Genie or Hex code. This key also works in stopped mode.
.It key_screenshot [f12]
Take a screenshot. Not available in 8 bpp mode.
.It key_prompt [:]
Pause emulation and display interactive prompt. Also works in stopped mode.
.It key_debug_enter [`]
Break into the debugger. Only meaningful if debugger support is compiled-in.
.El
.Sh PREFERENCES
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It int_hz [60]
Video refresh rate. The default is 60 as in NTSC consoles.
.It bool_pal [false]
When true, a PAL console is emulated. This should be used in combination with
int_hz above for 50Hz emulation.
.It region [' ']
U for America (NTSC), E for Europe (PAL), J for Japan (NTSC), X for Japan
(PAL), or empty space for autodetection (the default).
Overrides bool_pal and int_hz.
.It str_region_order [JUEX]
Regions DGen is allowed to emulate when autodetection is enabled, ordered by
preference.
.It emu_m68k_startup [musa]
Useful when both Musashi and StarScream are compiled-in. This option selects
the default emulator to use ("musa" for Musashi, "star" for StarScream, "none"
for neither). See key_cpu_toggle.
.It emu_z80_startup [cz80]
Useful when both CZ80 and MZ80 are compiled-in. This option selects the
default emulator to use ("cz80", "mz80" or "none", if you want to disable it
altogether). See key_z80_toggle.
.It bool_autoload [false]
Automatically load the saved state from slot 0 when DGen starts.
.It bool_autosave [false]
Automatically save the saved state to slot 0 upon exit. Setting both of these
fields true, you can exit DGen, and automatically start a game where you left
off when you start it again.
.It bool_autoconf [true]
Automatically dump the current configuration to dgenrc.auto before
exiting. This file is always loaded before dgenrc at startup.
.It bool_frameskip [true]
Automatically skip frames, when it is necessary to maintain proper emulation
speed. You may want to disable sound or set int_nice to a nonzero
value when setting this to false.
.It int_nice [0]
If set to a non-zero value, DGen will call
.Xr usleep 3
with the specified parameter
after rendering each frame. This will slow the program down (if it is running
too fast on your computer), and allow the operating system to reclaim some
CPU time.
.It ctv_craptv_startup [off]
CTV filter to use by default. Available filters are "blur", "scanline",
"interlace" and "swab".
.It scaling_startup [default]
Scaling algorithm to use when (int_scale > 1). Available algorithms are
"default", "hqx" and "scale2x".
Algorithms other than "default" may not work for all possible depths
and int_scale values. They are also more CPU-intensive but it's
usually worthwhile.
.It bool_show_carthead [false]
Show cartridge header info at startup.
.It bool_raw_screenshots [false]
Generate unfiltered screenshots.
.It str_rom_path ["roms"]
Directory where DGen should look for ROMs by default. It's relative to DGen's
home directory, unless an absolute path is provided.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
See the file "sample.dgenrc" in the DGen/SDL distribution.
.Sh KEY IDENTIFIERS
A key identifier can have the prefixes "shift-", "ctrl-", "alt-" and "meta-",
or any combination thereof, to require that the specified modifier be pressed
in combination with the key. For example, the identifier "alt-enter" would
correspond to holding down the Alt key while pressing Enter.
.Pp
The "shift-" modifier only works with keys that don't generate symbols (such
as arrow keys). Otherwise their UTF-8 representation must be used directly.
.Pp
The numbers "0" through "9" ("kp_0" through "kp_9" for the numeric keypad),
letters "A" through "Z", and function keys "F1" through "F12" map to their key
equivalents.
In addition, the following identifiers map to their similarly-labeled key
counterparts. Identifiers on the same line map to the same key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
escape
backspace

capslock	caps_lock
lshift		shift_l
rshift		shift_r
lctrl		ctrl_l
