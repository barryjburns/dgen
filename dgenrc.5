.Dt DGENRC 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dgenrc
.Nd file containing settings for
.Xr dgen 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
$HOME/.dgen/dgenrc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa $HOME/.dgen/dgenrc
is parsed by
.Xr dgen 1
when the emuator is started. It is used to set controller keys, as well as other
characteristics of the emulation. The contents of this file may be overriden
with the contents of another similarly-formatted file, via the
.Fl r
commandline switch.
.Sh FILE FORMAT
Each rc file consists of an unlimited number of lines, which each have the
format 'fieldname = value'. A line may also be a comment, if it begins with the
hash mark (#) character.
.Pp
Each
.Ar fieldname
is prepended by a name, which identifies the type of this field:
.Bl -tag -width bool_*
.It Ar key_*
A key value. May be set to a key identifier listed in the
.Sx KEY INDENTIFIERS
section below.
.It Ar bool_*
A boolean value. "false", "no", and "0" values are taken as false, while
"true", "yes", and any number except 0 are taken as true.
.It Ar int_*
An integer value, greater than or equal to 0.
.El
.Pp
Some fields take special value sets, which are addressed in their respective
sections. None of the field names or values are case-sensitive.
.Pp
The fields fall under a few basic groups. They are listed below, with their
default values in brackets ([]):
.Sh CONTROLLERS
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_pad1_up [up]
.It key_pad1_down [down]
.It key_pad1_left [left]
.It key_pad1_right [right]
.It key_pad1_a [a]
.It key_pad1_b [s]
.It key_pad1_c [d]
.It key_pad1_x [q]
.It key_pad1_y [w]
.It key_pad1_z [e]
.It key_pad1_mode [backspace]
.It key_pad1_start [return]
Map keys to the first Genesis controller. Each of these fields has a
corresponding "key_pad2" field, to map to the second controller.
.It bool_joystick [false]
Use joysticks to emulate the controllers. Note that the keyboard keys will
still work if this value is set. This field is only available if you have
joystick support enabled.
.It joypadX_bY
Maps button number Y, on joystick X to a Genesis controller button. Valid
button values are "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", "z", "mode", and "start". Joystick
1 will always emulate controller 1, and joystick 2 will always emulate
controller 2.
.El
.Sh AUDIO
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It bool_sound [true]
Enable the sound subsystem.
.It int_soundrate [22050]
Sound frequency to play at, in hertz (Hz).
.It bool_16bit [true]
Use 16-bit sound. If this is false, sound will be condensed to 8-bit (which
causes a speed penalty).
.It int_soundsegs [8]
Number of sound segments to use for sound buffering. Lower values guarantee
low latency. Increment this only if the sound becomes choppy.
.It int_soundsamples [0]
Size of the system sound buffer, in samples (samples are the sound unit, sound
rate is how many of them are played every second). Specifying 0 automatically
choses the safest value. If you experience sound issues int_soundsegs is
unable to solve, try to change this. Increasing it will cause noticeable audio
lag (it is unfortunately often required on slower machines).
.El
.Sh VIDEO
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It bool_opengl [true]
Use the OpenGL renderer, if it is available.
.It int_opengl_width [640]
The width of the OpenGL window to use.
.It int_opengl_height [480]
The height of the OpenGL window to use.
.It bool_opengl_ratio [true]
Retain original aspect ratio when resizing OpenGL window.
.It bool_opengl_linear [true]
Use GL_LINEAR for textures filtering instead of GL_NEAREST.
.It bool_opengl_32bit [false]
Use 32 bit textures. The only reason you may want to try this option is if
somehow 16 bit textures don't work properly.
.It bool_opengl_swap [false]
Swap textures endianness. Sometimes useful when video output is located on a
different system.
.It bool_fullscreen [false]
Try to run fullscreen, if possible.
.It int_scale [1]
Amount by which to scale the window from the default 320x240 resolution. This
does not affect the OpenGL renderer; it only has effect if the software
renderer is in use.
.It key_fullscreen_toggle [alt-enter]
Key to toggle fullscreen mode (this may do nothing if SDL doesn't support
fullscreen toggling on your platform.)
.El
.Sh SAVE STATES
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_slot_X [X]
Sets the current save-state slot to number X.
.It key_save [f2]
Saves state to the current slot.
.It key_load [f3]
Loads state from the current slot.
.El
.Sh MISCELLANEOUS KEYS
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It key_fix_checksum [f1]
Fixes the checksum value. Some older games will freeze with a red screen if
the ROM has been hacked or modified with Game Genie codes. If it does, pressing
this, and resetting should fix the problem.
.It key_quit [escape]
Exit DGen.
.It key_craptv_toggle [f5]
Toggles Crap-TV image filters. These filters aren't available in
OpenGL nor 8 bpp modes.
.It key_reset [tab]
Restart the Genesis emulation.
.It key_cpu_toggle [f11]
Switch CPU emulators. The x86 assembly CPU emulator StarScream is fast, but
has glitches which affect a few games. Switching to the slower Musashi core
will fix these problems, at a speed penalty.
.It key_stop [z]
Pause emulation, so you can concentrate on real life for a few seconds. :)
.It key_screenshot [f12]
Take a screenshot.
.El
.Sh PREFERENCES
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It bool_autoload [false]
Automatically load the saved state from slot 0 when DGen starts.
.It bool_autosave [false]
Automatically save the saved state to slot 0 upon exit. Setting both of these
fields true, you can exit DGen, and automatically start a game where you left
off when you start it again.
.It bool_frameskip [true]
Automatically skip frames, when it is necessary to maintain proper emulation
speed. You may want to disable sound or set int_nice to a nonzero
value when setting this to false.
.It bool_fullscreen [false]
Run in fullscreen mode, if it is available.
.It int_scale [1]
Amount by which to scale the window. Setting this to 2 will double the
dimensions of the window, 3 will triple it, and so on. It must be a positive
integer.
.It bool_opengl [false]
Use OpenGL mode to render the screen, if available.
.It int_opengl_width [640]
Width of the OpenGL resolution to use.
.It int_opengl_height [480]
Height of the OpenGL resolution to use.
.It int_nice [0]
If set to a non-zero value, DGen will call
.Xr usleep 3
with the specified parameter
after rendering each frame. This will slow the program down (if it is running
too fast on your computer), and allow the operating system to reclaim some
CPU time.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
See the file "sample.dgenrc" in the DGen/SDL distribution.
.Sh KEY IDENTIFIERS
A key identifier can have the prefixes "shift-", "ctrl-", "alt-" and "meta-",
or any combination thereof, to require that the specified modifier be pressed
in combination with the key. For example, the identifier "alt-enter" would
correspond to holding down the Alt key while pressing Enter.

The numbers "0" through "9" ("kp_0" through "kp_9" for the numeric keypad),
letters "A" through "Z", and function keys "F1" through "F12" map to their key
equivalents.
In addition, the following identifiers map to their similarly-labeled key
counterparts. Identifiers on the same line map to the same key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
escape
backspace
tab
capslock	caps_lock
lshift		shift_l
rshift		shift_r
lctrl		ctrl_l
lmeta		meta_l
lalt		alt_l
ralt		alt_r
rmeta		meta_r
rctrl		ctrl_r
return		enter
space
