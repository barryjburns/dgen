Emulation-related bugs
======================

This is a non-exhaustive list of games that are currently not working properly
in DGen due to bad or incomplete emulation.

Sometimes slower than it should be.

- Lotus 2 Recs
Sprites sometimes visible behind hills.

- Road Rash 1/2/3
EA intro is mangled.

- Sonic 2 prototype
No sound/music.

- Street Racer
Intro and some pictures are mangled, palette issues.

- Streets of Rage 1
Characters (and other sprites) are always drawn in front of the HUD.
Starting with level 2, weapons and items are drawn in front of all other
sprites.

- Aleste - Full metal fighter Ellinor
Sprites are drawn in front of the HUD.

- Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco

Non-working (must be fixed)
---------------------------

They either display a blank screen or crash after the intro.

Sprites colors are wrong, crashes when trying to start a game.
