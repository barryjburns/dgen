Emulation-related bugs
======================

This is a non-exhaustive list of games that are currently not working properly
in DGen due to bad or incomplete emulation.

Working, with glitches
----------------------

- Double Dragon 2
Sometimes slower than it should be.

- Sonic 2 prototype
No sound/music.

- Street Racer
Intro and some pictures are mangled, palette issues.

- Streets of Rage 1
Starting with level 2, weapons and items are drawn in front of all other
sprites.
End of level counter sound is bad.

- Aleste - Full metal fighter Ellinor
Some HUD areas are wrong.

- Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco
Sky is black and top screen color is wrong.

- Golden Axe 2
Some sort of loop at start that freezes DGen for a while.
Issue present with both Musashi and StarScream.

- Gynoug
Menu/intro backgrounds are mangled.

- Super Hang-on
Bad horizon line.
Sprites sometimes visible behind hills.

- Thunder force 3
Main weapon sound is bad.

- Thunder force 4
Corrupt intro.
Some versions don't work at all.

- Viewpoint
Menu background is mangled.

- Sonic 3
The Sonic 3 gumball bonus stage has some graphics problems. Get 50 rings and
jump into the stars above a lamp-post and play the special stage for a bit --
the bug is pretty obvious.

- Gunstar Heroes
The rocket level has some vertical scroll issues. Probably
the same issue that we see in the Sonic 3 gumball stages.

Non-working (must be fixed)
---------------------------

- All hacked games with added intros
They either display a blank screen or crash after the intro.

- Time killers
Blank screen.

- Lemmings 2 - The tribes
Sprites colors are wrong, crashes when trying to start a game.

- Sub Terrania
Crashes when starting a game.

- Zool
The game freezes after the EA logo on some versions.

Non-working (this is expected)
------------------------------

- Ya-Se Chuan Shuo
Freezes (missing hardware?)

- Virtua Racing
Missing proper hardware emulation.
