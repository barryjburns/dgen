WHAT'S NEW?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.23 <- v1.22
 * Added fullscreen toggle, using Alt-Enter by default.
 * Added the ability to set modifiers on key bindings, using the prefixes
   "shift-", "ctrl-", "alt-", and "meta-".
 * When 'z' is pressed to stop emulation while running fullscreen, the screen
   is toggled into windowed mode until emulation resumes. (assuming SDL
   supports this on your platform)
 * Fixed some buffer overflows in the rc parser.
 - Fixed a minor bug in creating the .dgen directory framework upon first run.
 * NASM is now required on x86 platforms.
 - Fixed a possible problem in the configure script detecting NASM object
   format on non-ELF platforms.

v1.22 <- v1.21
 * Fixed save RAM problems with some games that did not properly switch save
   RAM on/off, such as Shadowrun and Shining Force.
 * Fixed SDL joystick code, thanks to Cameron Moore <cameron@unbeatenpath.net>.
 * Fixed timing problems on FreeBSD and on very fast machines when playing with
   sound. If you use FreeBSD, I suggest updating to the latest 4-STABLE
   snapshot and rebuilding your kernel to get the best sound sync.
 * Added OpenGL rendering mode, thanks to Andre Souza <asouza@olinux.com.br>.
   See the '-G' option in the dgen(1) manpage or 'bool_opengl' in dgenrc(5)
   in order to activate it.
 * Added 'bool_fullscreen', 'int_scale', 'bool_opengl', 'int_opengl_width',
   and 'int_opengl_height' dgenrc fields, in order to allow fullscreen,
   scaling, and OpenGL preferences to be set permanently in dgenrc.

v1.21 <- v1.20a
 * Screenshot code added, courtesy of Allen Noe <psyclone42@geocities.com>.
   The key_screenshot field in dgenrc sets the key that will make screenshots
   happen. Its default is F12.
 * MZ80 core updated to version 3.4. Sound in Aladdin and the Sonic games should
   run at the correct speed now.
 * Fixed a bug in the handling of handling saved state and RAM filenames, which
   would result in saved state files being saved with a null filename.
 - Added a '-s' switch, which will load the given saved state at startup.
 * Added support for joystick through SDL for SDL 1.1.x.
 - Fixed compilation problems with the gcc "2.96" on Redhat 7.x systems. Thanks
   to Jeff Grady <jgrady@chimera.acm.jhu.edu>.

v1.20a <- 1.20
 - Fixed a tiny problem that caused MMX to be improperly detected on some Linux
   boxes.

v1.20 <- 1.18
 * DGen now uses autoconf/automake, so compiling DGen is now as easy as
   './configure && make && make install'.
   Because of this, though, you'll need to upgrade SDL to v1.0.1.
   The new Autoconf scripts are still a bit experimental; if it seems broken
   on your platform, try to fix it and send a patch.
 - I rewrote and reorganized documentation to better fit the way Automake likes
   to do things.
 * Manpages are now available, for dgen(1) and dgenrc(5).
 * If the normal window size is too small for you, you can now scale the window
   with the new -X and -Y options.

v1.19 <- v1.18
 - $%&($! Nothing was working!

v1.18 <- v1.17
 * Enormous speed increase, thanks to the hard work of John Stiles, who also
   has put all interrupt bugs to rest, finally.
 * DGen works in FreeBSD! The included Makefile.config.FreeBSD should work
   without modifications. You need the GNU make and EGCS ports, though.
 * Demo record/play! You can record a demo of yourself playing a game with the
   '-d DEMONAME' switch, i.e. "dgen -d foo.demo my_rom.smd". Then play it back
   later with "dgen -D foo.demo my_rom.smd". Also, no verifaction checks are
   done on the demos, so you can feed it arbitrary files and see what happens,
   if you like. :)

v1.17 <- v1.16
 * Save RAM implementation has been overhauled, so now games with overlapping
   ROM and save RAM (like Phantasy Star IV and Sonic 3 + Knuckles) can save
   games correctly. Many thanks to Steve Snake for helping me make this work
   right.
 * Crude PAL mode support, give the '-P' option to use it. Doesn't work very
   well yet.
 - I made some changes that should (hopefully) make DGen run properly on
   big-endian platforms, but I don't have any way of testing it. If you have
   a PowerPC, SPARC, or other big-endian system, give it a try and help me
   iron out the wrinkles. :)
 * Window is now emulated properly, so Herzog Zwei split-screen and other
   little bugs should be fixed. Thanks again to Steve.
 - A little bug that caused SDL to complain about not being able to
   initialize sound, even if bool_sound was false in dgenrc, was fixed. This
   should help all you folks without sound cards.
 * Assembler tile rendering is now in place for the new raster effect engine.
   A small but noticeable speed increase. :) [PKH]
 * All the SDL-dependent stuff has been separated into the sdl/ directory,
   and I wrote a little platform-dependent (pd) API so you can attach an
   interface for your favorite Unix-like operating system and toolkit. :)
   If you want to do a port to BeOS, MacOS X, QNX, etc. this should make your
   life easier. I also hope to have raw Xlib and SVGAlib interfaces to replace
   SDL, and thus require one less thing to download. :)
 - Improved sound writing method, by Daniel Wislocki <wislocki@math.grin.edu>.
   He says this improves flaky sound in 44kHz, and also fixes the problem of
   the emulator being too fast. I have a very slow computer, so I have to take
   his word for it. ;)
 - I also removed most of the messages dgen makes (except for errors), so that
   it is quieter. If you liked having all those messages, tell me and I'll put
   them back in. ;)
