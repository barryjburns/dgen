WHAT'S NEW?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.29 <- v1.28
 * Reduced CPU consumption.
 * Prevented CZ80 from crashing when handling invalid code.
 * OpenGL: added configuration option to force square textures.
 * OpenGL: fixed non-power of two texture size issue from v1.28.
 * Fixed save files to manage YM2612 timers properly.
 * Fixed the way files are opened relative to DGen's home directory.
 * YM2612 timers are now managed externally by DGen.
 * Removed unused support for M68KEM.
 * Refactored memory handling, frame generation and initialization routines.
   As a side effect, DGen can run more games now.
 * Fixed remaining bugs in Z80 and M68K hot swapping code.
 * Updated AUTHORS file.
 * Added BUGS file for unresolved emulation bugs.
 * Imported hqx filters. hq2x is available for 15/16 and 32 bit, hq3x and
   hq4x are only available for 32 bit modes.
 * Refactored graphics output functions. Filtering and scaling are now
   in separate functions and new filters can be added easily.
 * Improved joystick devices configuration.
 * Fixed ASM files to ensure non-executable stack on ELF targets.
 * Merged OpenGL and normal fonts to remove redundant code. There are now
   three fonts available: 7x5 (original OpenGL font), 8x13 and 16x26.
 * Fixed other minor bugs.

v1.28 <- v1.27
 * ROM loader can now use libarchive when available for decompression. This
   replaces the previous system()-based implementation.
 * "tobin" has been renamed "dgen_tobin" and no longer has dependencies on
   SDL and other unnecessary libraries.
 * CZ80: fixed emulation bug ("weird sound") introduced just before the 1.27
   release.
 * Improved CZ80/MZ80 switching.
 * Improved save file handling. Z80 context and other important things are now
   stored. The format is mostly compatible with Gens v5 and save states can be
   exchanged between both emulators. Old save files are still supported.
 * YM2612: upgraded from version 0.35f to 1.4b, as found in Final Burn Alpha.
   Sound quality has improved as a result.
 * Improved sound buffer management again, a single buffer is now used with
   both channels instead of two separate buffers.
 * Removed 8-bit sound output format since it was useless and annoying to
   support with the new buffer.
 * Removed superfluous window resizing messages.
 * Game Genie codes can now be entered while in stopped mode to avoid crashes
   when more than one is needed at once. Also, DGen now supports RAM patching.
 * Corrected clock frequencies for YM2612 and SN76496, sound is pitched a bit
   higher than before.
 * Added region selection command-line option. This option reuses "-R"
   (realtime priority). In case this option isn't given, the default region
   used by DGen is now the first found in the ROM header. This option has no
   effect on PAL (50Hz) mode which needs to be enabled separately.
 * OpenGL: a single OpenGL texture (and subtexture) is now used instead of two
   smaller ones, thus removing some of the complexity.
 * Usual batch of miscellaneous bugfixes.

v1.27 <- v1.26
 * Documentation clean-up, sample.dgenrc update.
 * Compilation fixes for MZ80.
 * When both Musashi and StarScream are available, default to Musashi since
   it provides better emulation.
 * Imported CZ80 0.91. This Z80 emulator is pure C and works better than the C
   version of MZ80. This means that on non-x86/32 bit hardware, games that
   previously didn't have sound now work properly (Sonic 2 for instance).
   Thanks to DGen PSP which implemented CZ80 first.
 * Modified CZ80 to work properly on big-endian machines.
 * When both CZ80 and MZ80 are available, CZ80 is now the default.
 * DGen can now be compiled without any external modules. MZ80, CZ80, Musashi
   and StarScream can all be disabled.
 * There's now a toggle key (F10 by default) to switch between MZ80, CZ80 or
   neither.
 * The Musashi/StarScream toggle key can now disable them both.
 * New rc variables for selecting default emulators.
 * FPS are now calculated every second for a more accurate message at exit.
 * Implemented bool_show_carthead.
 * Game Genie codes can now be entered interactively by pressing F9. They can
   also be disabled by re-entering them.
 * Various other fixes.

v1.26 <- v1.25
 * Upgraded Musashi from 2.0 to 3.3.1. This version solves various emulation
   problems.
 * Reworked autoconf and automake scripts to improve readability and
   portability.
 * Added support for MinGW. DGen can now run in Windows.
 * Fixed messy border again, this time for all video color depths.
 * OpenGL: added bool_opengl_aspect to keep the original aspect ratio during
   resizing. This option is enabled by default.
 * Added support for 24 bpp (3 Bpp) mode.
 * Made Crap TV filters available for all architectures, color depths and
   OpenGL.
 * OpenGL: fixed GL_LINEAR support so it can be used again instead of
   GL_NEAREST, one can switch between them with bool_opengl_linear
   (enabled by default).
 * Refactored the main loop and SDL code for a smooth frame rate with an
   improved sound synchronization.
 * Made a wrapper to open and create files relative to user's home directory
   in a system-independant manner.
 * Fixed Z80 speed in NTSC mode, sound effects were abnormally high pitched.
 * Improved FPS counter.
 * Removed SIGALRM for improved portability.
 * OpenGL: now enabled by default when available.
 * MZ80: fixed segfault on reset.
 * OpenGL: use 16 bpp mode internally instead of 32, allow textures to be 16
   (default) or 32 bit with bool_opengl_32bit.
 * OpenGL: added bool_opengl_swap to byte-swap colors when the host computer
   endianness is not the same as the ouptut (possible with X11 sessions).
 * Screenshots are now generated from the internal video buffer as TARGA files
   so they are available in all modes (OpenGL or not) and depths (except 8 bpp,
   as usual). Their output directory is ~/.dgen/screenshots.
 * OpenGL: the message bar now spans both textures.
 * Improved stopped mode to be less easily unstopped and to avoid dropping
   frames. Also, it now accepts resizes and refreshes.
 * Added the -H option to tweak emulation speed. Can be used to run 50Hz games
   at 60Hz.

v1.25 <- v1.24
 * Added 64 bits targets support, DGen can now run on those.
 * Minor fix for joystick/joypad when sizeof(int) != sizeof(long).
 * Fixed messy border issue (garbage on the right of the screen).
 * OpenGL: worked around the vertical dark line between textures.
 * OpenGL: the visible area now takes the entire window (except for the
   status line). No more borders.
 * OpenGL: the window can now be resized/rescaled at runtime.
 * Fixed bug in which SDL-specific fields in dgenrc were not taken into
   account when no command-line option was given.
 * Replaced dgenrc parser with a better one. It breaks compatibility a
   little with the previous version because special characters now need to
   be escaped or put between quotation marks.
 * Improved configure and Makefiles for proper SDL/OpenGL detection,
   better dependencies in parallel builds, NASM's presence on x86 targets
   which shouldn't be mandatory and various other things.
 * Fixed many crashes.
 * Removed many compilation warnings.

v1.24 <- v1.23
 * Fixed compilation on GCC 4.

v1.23 <- v1.22
 * Added fullscreen toggle, using Alt-Enter by default.
 * Added the ability to set modifiers on key bindings, using the prefixes
   "shift-", "ctrl-", "alt-", and "meta-".
 * When 'z' is pressed to stop emulation while running fullscreen, the screen
   is toggled into windowed mode until emulation resumes. (assuming SDL
   supports this on your platform)
 * Fixed some buffer overflows in the rc parser.
 - Fixed a minor bug in creating the .dgen directory framework upon first run.
 * NASM is now required on x86 platforms.
 - Fixed a possible problem in the configure script detecting NASM object
   format on non-ELF platforms.

v1.22 <- v1.21
 * Fixed save RAM problems with some games that did not properly switch save
   RAM on/off, such as Shadowrun and Shining Force.
 * Fixed SDL joystick code, thanks to Cameron Moore <cameron@unbeatenpath.net>.
 * Fixed timing problems on FreeBSD and on very fast machines when playing with
   sound. If you use FreeBSD, I suggest updating to the latest 4-STABLE
   snapshot and rebuilding your kernel to get the best sound sync.
 * Added OpenGL rendering mode, thanks to Andre Souza <asouza@olinux.com.br>.
   See the '-G' option in the dgen(1) manpage or 'bool_opengl' in dgenrc(5)
   in order to activate it.
 * Added 'bool_fullscreen', 'int_scale', 'bool_opengl', 'int_opengl_width',
   and 'int_opengl_height' dgenrc fields, in order to allow fullscreen,
   scaling, and OpenGL preferences to be set permanently in dgenrc.

v1.21 <- v1.20a
 * Screenshot code added, courtesy of Allen Noe <psyclone42@geocities.com>.
   The key_screenshot field in dgenrc sets the key that will make screenshots
   happen. Its default is F12.
 * MZ80 core updated to version 3.4. Sound in Aladdin and the Sonic games should
   run at the correct speed now.
 * Fixed a bug in the handling of handling saved state and RAM filenames, which
   would result in saved state files being saved with a null filename.
 - Added a '-s' switch, which will load the given saved state at startup.
 * Added support for joystick through SDL for SDL 1.1.x.
 - Fixed compilation problems with the gcc "2.96" on Redhat 7.x systems. Thanks
   to Jeff Grady <jgrady@chimera.acm.jhu.edu>.

v1.20a <- 1.20
 - Fixed a tiny problem that caused MMX to be improperly detected on some Linux
   boxes.

v1.20 <- 1.18
 * DGen now uses autoconf/automake, so compiling DGen is now as easy as
   './configure && make && make install'.
   Because of this, though, you'll need to upgrade SDL to v1.0.1.
   The new Autoconf scripts are still a bit experimental; if it seems broken
   on your platform, try to fix it and send a patch.
 - I rewrote and reorganized documentation to better fit the way Automake likes
   to do things.
 * Manpages are now available, for dgen(1) and dgenrc(5).
 * If the normal window size is too small for you, you can now scale the window
   with the new -X and -Y options.

v1.19 <- v1.18
 - $%&($! Nothing was working!

v1.18 <- v1.17
 * Enormous speed increase, thanks to the hard work of John Stiles, who also
   has put all interrupt bugs to rest, finally.
 * DGen works in FreeBSD! The included Makefile.config.FreeBSD should work
   without modifications. You need the GNU make and EGCS ports, though.
 * Demo record/play! You can record a demo of yourself playing a game with the
   '-d DEMONAME' switch, i.e. "dgen -d foo.demo my_rom.smd". Then play it back
   later with "dgen -D foo.demo my_rom.smd". Also, no verifaction checks are
   done on the demos, so you can feed it arbitrary files and see what happens,
   if you like. :)

v1.17 <- v1.16
 * Save RAM implementation has been overhauled, so now games with overlapping
   ROM and save RAM (like Phantasy Star IV and Sonic 3 + Knuckles) can save
   games correctly. Many thanks to Steve Snake for helping me make this work
   right.
 * Crude PAL mode support, give the '-P' option to use it. Doesn't work very
   well yet.
 - I made some changes that should (hopefully) make DGen run properly on
   big-endian platforms, but I don't have any way of testing it. If you have
   a PowerPC, SPARC, or other big-endian system, give it a try and help me
   iron out the wrinkles. :)
 * Window is now emulated properly, so Herzog Zwei split-screen and other
   little bugs should be fixed. Thanks again to Steve.
 - A little bug that caused SDL to complain about not being able to
   initialize sound, even if bool_sound was false in dgenrc, was fixed. This
   should help all you folks without sound cards.
 * Assembler tile rendering is now in place for the new raster effect engine.
   A small but noticeable speed increase. :) [PKH]
 * All the SDL-dependent stuff has been separated into the sdl/ directory,
   and I wrote a little platform-dependent (pd) API so you can attach an
   interface for your favorite Unix-like operating system and toolkit. :)
   If you want to do a port to BeOS, MacOS X, QNX, etc. this should make your
   life easier. I also hope to have raw Xlib and SVGAlib interfaces to replace
   SDL, and thus require one less thing to download. :)
 - Improved sound writing method, by Daniel Wislocki <wislocki@math.grin.edu>.
   He says this improves flaky sound in 44kHz, and also fixes the problem of
   the emulator being too fast. I have a very slow computer, so I have to take
   his word for it. ;)
 - I also removed most of the messages dgen makes (except for errors), so that
   it is quieter. If you liked having all those messages, tell me and I'll put
   them back in. ;)
